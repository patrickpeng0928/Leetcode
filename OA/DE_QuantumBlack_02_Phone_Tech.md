# Tech Preparation for DE - QuantumBlack
## Introduction
I am a Data Engineer in Synchrony Financial. I joined the company one year ago after I graduated with Master of Computer Science from University of Chicago. I embraced Big Data since I was in the Master program. In school, I learnt cutting edge Big data technologies and completed project with Lambda Architecture. I also implemented a full stack Big data application in AWS in a course project. I additionally found an opportunity to work with a professor to explore machine learning algorithms with synthetic data and create semi-learning application and framework in distributed computers. In the company, I worked closely with credit team, which is our business team and cash cow in the company. I performed all kinds of data ETL from ingesting data from all kinds of sources, tokenizing data, cleaning data, loading data to hive tables, to presenting data in Tableau. From data ingestion prospects, I created data pipeline from relational data warehouse, from Kafka topics, and even from mainframe computer via ssh. I also used Protegrity to tokenize/detokenize PII data. For normal data transformation, I used Spark, sometimes I used Hive. I worked collaborately with modeling team to implement machine learning models in the Data Lake by providing them specific data. I worked with tech lead in the team to optimize the developing process within team and maintain coding standard and best practices. I abstracted the need from different requirements and created generic models to be used in different projects, and reduced coding and testing time. Besides daily job, I also worked with tech team with CICD process, and Jira optimization.

## Case
### Transmit Kafka Ingestion and reporting (ETL)
* Data Ingestion
* Data ETL
* Hive table and Tableau presentation

### DWH Ingestion (Terabytes data ingestion and optimization, Hive table management)
* Sqoop
* Hive
* Parquet
* Partitioned
* Snappy
* Spark

### MainFrame Ingestion (multiple ingestion)
* SCP

### PWC model implementation (work with DS)
* Data ingestion
* Modeling implementation

### Lambda Architecture (System Architecture)
* Machine learning on analysis customer reviews from yelp datasets
* Batch process: running on existing Gigabytes datasets and stored all result in HBase tables
* Realtime process: used a website to gather realtime rating from customers and used storm to send data to Kafka topics
* Back engine will get data from Kafka topic and update HBase table
* Web interface to get result from HBase table

### Data validation (Data ETL)
### Protegrity(Security and TOkenization)
### Best Practice
### CICD workflow

### Machine learning project
* Semi learning frame work
* Synthetic 2-D data
* edge detection
* Hyper-parameter tuning

### Questions
* If I join the team, what will be my immediate responsibility? What area do you think I can immediately contribute? What part of my project/experience interested you the most?
* What expectation do you have on me in 1 or 2 years? What specific area do you have in mind that I will grow into?
* How do you evaluate success of a project?
* What kind of process do you have when designing features?
* Any travel?
* How many people are currently in your team? Whatis the distribution between senior and junior engineers?
* What is the relationship between data engineer and data scientists, and customers?
* Who are our customers? internal or external?
* What is your ideal number of members in a team? When do you think you can reach the ideal number of team members and how? What size of team do you expect in 1 or 2 years?
* When evaluating an engineer during performance review, what do you care the most?
