# 231. [Power of Two](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-two/)

## Description
Given an integer (signed 32 bits), write a function to check whether it is a power of 4.

Example 1:
```
Input: 16
Output: true
```
Example 2:
```
Input: 5
Output: false
```

**Follow up**:

Could you solve it without loops/recursion?

## Solutions
### Math
* Algorithm

Brut force - loop

n%4%4 ... %4 == 1

* Recursive
n % 4 == 0

Start point:
```
n <= 0 - False
n == 1 - True
```

* Exhaustive

all numbers that can be divided by 4:
```
1, 4, 16, 64, 256, 1024, 4096, 16384, 65536, 262144, 1048576, 4194304, 16777216, 67108864, 268435456, 1073741824
```

* log 4

n == 4 ** int(math.log(n, 4))


### Bit Manipulation - O(1), O(1)
* Algorithm

n & (n - 1) == 0

(n - 1) % 3 == 0

1s are not at odd position: using 0101...01 = 0x55555555


### String
* Algorithm

number of 0 in binary repr is even and there is only one '1' in the binary repr.

in Python, the binary repr is in the '0bxxxxx' format.

(n)4 = 100...00 => count(1) = 1, count(0) == even

### Bit Manipulation

n & (n - 1) = 0
