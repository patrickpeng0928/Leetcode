# 136. Single Number

## Description
Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Example 1:
```
Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1
```
Example 2:
```
Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```

## Solutions
### Bit Manipulation - O(n), O(1)
* Concept

If we take XOR of zero and some bit, it will return that bit
```
a⊕0=a
```
If we take XOR of two same bits, it will return 0
```
a⊕a=0
```
* Conclusion
```
a⊕b⊕a=(a⊕a)⊕b=0⊕b=b
```
So we can XOR all bits together to find the unique number.

### List Operation - O(n^2), O(n)
* Algorithm

	* Iterate over all the elements in nums
	* If some number in nums is new to array, append it
	* If some number is already in the array, remove it

### Hash Table - O(n), O(n)
* Algorithm

We use hash table to avoid the O(n) time required for searching the elements.

* Iterate through all elements in nums
* Try if hash_table has the key for pop
* If not, set up key/value pair
* In the end, there is only one element in hash_table, so use popitem to get it

### Math - O(n), O(n)
* Concept

\(2 * ( a + b + c ) - ( a + a + b + b + c) = c\)

* Complexity Analysis

	* Time complexity : O(n+n)=O(n). sum will call next to iterate through *nums*. We can see it as sum(list(i, for i in *nums*)) which means the time complexity is O(n) because of the number of elements(n) in *nums*.

	* Space complexity : O(n+n)=O(n). set needs space for the elements in *nums*
