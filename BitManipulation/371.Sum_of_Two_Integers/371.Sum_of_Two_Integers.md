# 371. [Sum of Two Integers](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-two-integers/)

## Description
Calculate the sum of two integers a and b, but you are not allowed to use the operator + and -.

Example 1:
```
Input: a = 1, b = 2
Output: 3
```
Example 2:
```
Input: a = -2, b = 3
Output: 1
```

## Solutions
### Bit Manipulation - O(1), O(1)
* Algorithm

result w/o carray: a ^ b
carray: (a & b) << 1

### String
* Algorithm

number of 0 in binary repr is even and there is only one '1' in the binary repr.

in Python, the binary repr is in the '0bxxxxx' format.

(n)4 = 100...00 => count(1) = 1, count(0) == even

### Bit Manipulation

n & (n - 1) = 0
